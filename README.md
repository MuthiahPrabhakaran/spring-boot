# spring-boot

This repository contains various sub projects for different spring modules

* [Spring Cloud](./cloud)
* [Actuator](./actuator)
* [Redis](./jedis)
* [Kafka](./kafka)
* [Data-JPA](./spring-boot-jpa)
* [Versioning](./versioning)
* [Maven-Parent](./parent)
* [Common](./common)

In few projects, I didn't follow the standard practice. The aim of this repo is to give an example for various spring projects. 

I am still updating codes and junits when I get free time.

Feel free to fork and contribute :grinning:
